#include <stdio.h>


/* PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS:

   Input: Just the machine itself

   Output: 1 if the machine is "little_endian" and 0 otherwise 


   APPROACH: 

   Since this needs to work on every possible machine *regardless* of
   word size, we choose to use uint_32 as our base as this is defined 
   a data type of 4 bytes regardless of the machine.
